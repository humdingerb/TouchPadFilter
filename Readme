TouchpadSensitivityFilter
(for lack of a better name)

Most OSs have drivers for laptops which will allow the automatic dismissal of mouse-down events while typing. BeOS is not, to my knowledge, one of them. Fortunately for us, Be made it remarkably simple to write filters to the input_server, which can listen in on the input stream and make any changes we deem 'useful'. TouchpadSensitivityFilter takes care of this problem.

To install
Drag TouchpadSensitivityFilter.so onto the symlink in this directory (~/config/settings/add-ons/input_server/filters) with the obvious name.

Restart the input server, either by rebooting (if your terminal-phobic) or opening the terminal and typing:
/boot/beos/system/servers/input_server -q
The mouse and keyboard will go dead for a second or two as the input server restarts, and the add-ons are loaded. Poof. You're good to go.

To change sensitivity
The first time the filter is run, it will make a default settings file in ~/config/settings named "touchpad_sensitivity_filter_prefs.txt". This is just a text file, containing a number representing in millis the delay between when the last key-up message is handled and when the next mouse-down message will be allowed. you can set this number to whatever you want, but I imagine anything more than 500 (half a second) would be counter-productive. Since the threshold is loaded on instantiation of the filter (eg, when the input_server is fired up) any changes you make won't be noticed until the server is restarted, manually, or on reboot. It didn't seem worthwhile to me to write a node-monitor into this bugger.

I've included the source, not that it's particularly complex. But since I couldn't find useful documentation in the html be book about BInputServerFilter (note: as of r5 docs do exist) I had to read several Be headers and rip apart some of the code in boot/optional/sample-code. So I figure if anybody wants to write a filter, this is a good simple code-base for you. Enjoy

If you find any bugs or, preferably, just want to give me a big sloppy kiss

Thanks to Magnus Landahl for writing his superb Be Debug Console without which I would not have been able to verify that this thing actually worked or not. (it does)
